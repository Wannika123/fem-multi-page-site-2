## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for the Family Gatherings, Special Events, and Social Events section when the user clicks each tab
- Receive an error message when the booking form is submitted if:
  - The `Name` or `Email Address` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
  - Any of the `Pick a date` or `Pick a time` fields are empty should show "This field is incomplete"

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - use server action for form submission

### What I learned

- Never underestimate the form. I try to make it as accessible as possible. Also, I'm still not very comfortable with building custom select component, it took me so long.

### Useful resources

- [custom select component](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAJlYgeovlg&t=3s) - I have to reference this every time I build select component.
